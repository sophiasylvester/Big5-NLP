Structure of the result files:


The result files are ordered into folders according to their appearance in the thesis. 

The files are named according to the following scheme:
1. traits to predict
2. name of the dataset
3. model (classifier or predictor)
4. classes (binary, multi or continuous scores =linear)
5. algorithm for feature selection
6. PCA (true or false)
7. number of features
8. name of file (if applicable)

For the regression the names were shortened to:
1. regressor
2. feature selection algorithm
3. PCA (true or false)
4. number of features

All subfolders named plot_<name> contain plots separately for each trait. The plots are ROc curves and confusion matrices for the classifiers and regression plots for the regressors.



In the csv-files containing classification results the following content can be found per trait: 
- average accuracy
- average macro F1 score
- average auc score
- accuracy per fold
- macro f1 score per fold
- auc score per fold
- parameters determined via grid search (per fold)
- the names of the features selected and used for the prediction (per fold; only if PCA was not used)


In the csv-files containing regression results the following content can be found per trait: 
- average r squared score
- average MSE 
- the names of the features selected and used for the prediction (per fold; only if PCA was not used)





study1

The folder study1 contains the results of:
- classifiers: Logistic regression (LR), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (svm) and majority class classifier (MCC) as baseline
- feature selection: ANOVA
- number of features: 30

Its subfolder test_featureimportance contains the experiments on feature relevance, i.e., the pipeline with 30 features, ANOVA and MLP but smaller input feature sets, namely:
- word n-grams
- character n-grams
- wordlists
- post features
- post features but without the names of the subreddits.




study 2:
The folder study2 contains the results of the following experiments:
1. datasubset: predicting big five and mbti scores from da subset of authors with both labels
2. nfeatures: the number of features (1, 5, 10, 20 or 30 and 30 with PCA)
3. clf: new classifiers, namely naive bayes (NB), decision tree (DT), random forest classifier (RFC), and gradient boost classifier (GBC)
4. featureselection: new algorithms, namely mutual information and forward sequential feature selection
5. augmenteddata




study 3:
The folder study3 contains the results of the following regressors:
- linear regression (LIR), gradient boost regressor (gbr), random forest regressor (rfr), and multi-layer perceptron regression (mlpr)




appendix:
The folder appendix contains the results of the multiclass classification. We realized five classes and tested them with MLP, ANOVA and 10 features.
